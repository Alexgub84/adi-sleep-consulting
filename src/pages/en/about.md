# Hello, Nice to Meet You

**Sleep and Breastfeeding Consultant with an Attachment-Based Approach.**

My name is **Adi Brodsly**

I accompany parents – from pregnancy through age 5 – in the early moments of parenthood, with challenges around breastfeeding, improving sleep and weaning, in a way that is attentive to your needs as well as those of your children.

## My Approach – Attachment-Based, Professional and Sensitive

My work is based on the attachment parenting approach – a method developed by developmental psychologist Gordon Neufeld, and well-known in Israel through various pathways such as "Hugging Parenting."

This approach sees the close connection between parent and child as the foundation for healthy emotional, cognitive, and behavioral development, and invites us to understand the needs behind behaviors.

I don't work with rigid methods or one-size-fits-all solutions, but rather offer a sensitive and tailored process, built together – according to what suits your family, during which we'll better understand the child's needs and, by responding to them, in most cases, we'll see improvement in daily life and sleep.
